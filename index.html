<h1 class="title-rose">About me</h1>
<p> I'm brazilian and graduated in Business Managment in 2019. In 2016 I got a intership program (Customer Support) at Philips, and that was my first contact with IT.
    I was amazed about all the possibilities, and since then I have been building my career in tech companies.
    My professional background includes experience with Customer Service and Engagment, IT Support, Troubleshooting and Projects.
<br>
I'm currently working as a Customer Success Manager, and throughout this journey, I had the oportunity to participate actively and directly with tasks and projects focused on customer experience strategies, solving problems and finding creative solutions in the companies I have worked for. This allowed me to build strong communication, relationship and teamwork skills.
 I am always aware of processes that can be improved and facilitated, and this helps me to constantly develop my problem solving ability.
 <br>
 <br>
 In 2022, I decided to take a next step on my career, I started to study software development focusing on Front End.
 I am documenting my learnings and projects on Github: <a class="href" href ="https://github.com/luisatiedt">https://github.com/luisatiedt</a>
